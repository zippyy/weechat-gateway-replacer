* Gateway Nick Converter
Telegram, Slack and other IRC gateways frequently send under single user name that
with the /true/ username prefixed to the message like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
r2tg | <oddcoder> the shellcoder handbook really goes without any discussion on how to setup the server to exploit it just said (setup up the server)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a weechat plugin that will let you modify the gateway messages with the
real nick.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
oddcoder | the shellcoder handbook really goes without any discussion on how to setup the server to exploit it just said (setup up the server)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Adding New Nicks
This plugin doesn't expose any configuration details to weechat, if you'd like
 to add another gateway<->nick matching pair, you can [[https://github.com/zv/weechat-gateway-replacer/blob/master/plugin.scm#L20-L23][add another regexp here]]
